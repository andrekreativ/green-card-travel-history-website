# green-card-travel-history-website
Website to help green card holders travel and stay inside the USA 6 months out of the last 12 months.

I created this simple website with ChatGPT to demonstrate how to use prompt engineering with generative AI to write code.

I include all the prompts and the evolution of the generated code by ChatGPT on every commit. You can see in the commit description or in the comments of the commit what input I gave ChatGPT to drive it to make changes to the code and fix bugs along the way.
